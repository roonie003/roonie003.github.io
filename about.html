          <p>The café-in-a-can is a concentrate of all we enjoy most in entertaining. </p>
          <p>It’s intimate, relaxed, and with décor by crack Egg Designs duo Roche and Greg Dry, unselfconsciously stylish. The menu is ‘local, fresh, direct.’

            Guests watch through a hatch in the compact courtyard kitchen, even wander through this en route to the loo. They linger contentedly under trees strung with jam-jar lights and beaded dreams (‘joy,’ ‘love,’ ‘peace’), nursing cappy and cupcakes on yellow wire Egg rockers or black plastic daxie benches. Then as the shadow of neighbouring St Mary’s church spire creeps slowly across the sand..</p>
